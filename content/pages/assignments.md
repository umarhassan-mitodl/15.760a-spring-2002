**Assignment**

Take the position of a consultant to Webvan. Write a memo to the CEO of Webvan, providing him with your assessment of the Webvan operations model and business model *based solely on the information available in the case*. Include in your assessment some analysis of the value proposition to customers as well as the value proposition to investors. (i.e., how profitable will Webvan likely be?) (Max length: 1500 words & six supporting exhibits.)

We all know that Webvan went broke. Feel free to take the position either that the business could make money (and provide the assumptions and/or analysis and/or creative ideas that support your position) or that the business is hopeless. If you take the latter position, you still need to back up your assessment with an analysis of why you concluded what you did. (i.e., what *specifically* are the flaws in the business model or operations assumptions?)

2\. What industry trends are likely to affect cranberry processing and how?

3\. What are the sources of the variability that NCC is subjected to?

4\. Develop a process flow diagram, showing the capacities of the various stages in barrels per hour.

5\. Suppose that a peak harvest-season day involves 18,000 barrels of berries, 70% of them wet harvested, arriving over a twelve-hour period from 7 am to 7 pm. Would trucks have to wait to unload? When during the day would trucks be waiting? How much truck waiting time would you expect?

6\. How would the various actions contemplated by Hugo Schaeffer affect peak day performance? Suppose the cost of renting cranberry trucks with drivers is $10.00 per hour. What would you recommend? Why?

Queueing Systems

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

**Questions**

1\. Draw a process flow diagram that reflects the current UHS walk-in clinic operations.

2\. What are the sources of variability in this system?

3\. Using the average service rate for nurse practitioners given in the case, compute their utilization rate, averaged over the whole week. Compute their utilization rate for the peak hour, Mondays, 8:00-9:00am. What assumptions did you make to get these answers?

4\. Perform the same analysis for the doctors, assuming that the clinic operates without allowing patient requests for specific providers.

5\. Use the queueing models to compute the mean waiting time in queue for nurse practitioners. Try to explain any discrepancies you find. How can theoretical queueing models provide additional insight?

6\. What recommendations would you make to improve service at the walk-in clinic?

(NOTE: This week might provide an ideal opportunity to begin reading *The Goal*, to be read for class by Lecture #13.)

## {{< anchor "writtenassignments" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Written Assignments

In preparing the three written case analyses, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Work individually or in groups of two or three students. No groups of four will be permitted. We discourage individual work on the written assignments as we have found that groups develop significantly better solutions.
2. Hand in one copy of the case write-up for each group.
3. Written assignments are to be turned in the classroom on the day they are due.
4. Please keep a copy of your write-up for your own use during class discussion.
5. Written assignments must be less than 1500 words in length, accompanied by up to 6 supporting exhibits. This is a firm constraint.
6. Exhibits should contain specific types of analysis, such as financial analysis, break-even charts, cost analysis, process-flow analysis, etc. Exhibits should contain any relevant supporting information that is too detailed for the body of the paper. Exhibits must not be simply an extension of the text. We will not distribute written solutions to the write-ups, but rather will rely on the class session associated with the case to bring out the most important issues.

The case write-ups are graded using the following criteria (a version of these criteria will accompany your graded assignments):

**Analysis**

1. Does the paper contain analysis of the major issues?
2. Does the analysis incorporate properly the relevant tools?
3. Are assumptions made in the analysis stated explicitly?
4. Does the analysis isolate the fundamental causes of problems in the case?

**Recommended Actions**

1. Are the criteria for choosing among alternative recommendations stated?
2. Are the criteria appropriate?
3. Is the plan of action integrated in a logical way and linked to the analysis?
4. Is the action plan specific, complete and practical?
5. Is it likely that the recommendations will achieve their intended results?

**Exhibits**

1. Are the analyses in the exhibits done correctly?
2. Do the exhibits support and add to the text on key points?

**Presentation**

1. Is the paper too long?
2. Is the presentation of professional quality?
3. Is the paper logically consistent and effectively structured to sell its recommendations?
